MIX.pm
======

 (This is the CORE, so it is very important)


Full IO implementation          5h
   - Plan/Doc/Buffer            1h   1h,50%
   - Tape/Disk                  1h   this is relatively easy
   - Pape tape/                 2h   1h,50% need investigation? what's the diff between
                                     typewriter and paper tape? what they are put together
				     30min, I still didn't figure out
				     how to implement this device

   - optimize the time spent    1h
     on wait io device ready:
     JBUS *

Documentation
   - all public function calls documented
   - arch design / why I choose the design
   - why the function has such protocol
   - in what way they are expected to be used
   - defects, now I may think some places could be improved
   - how to simplify??
   -


Performance improvement
Test suites



Use get_trace_stat() instead of separated get_exec_time() and get_exec_cnt().


MIXSIM
======

1. prepare card deck??
2. save/load memory dump file
4. detail help

  doc

accept a mixasm file directly?

explaination of card deck?


MIXASM
======

1. error report should be taken into account

check var length, check the label field fit into 10 chars
check the spaces

check at the parse phase 1.

see 360/MIX
