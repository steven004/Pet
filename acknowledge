The framework is completed in 2010. Now I'd like to open it for sharing.

There is some code contributed by my ex-coworkers. Thanks for their supporting and encouraging.

Most code under Tea folder is contributed by Matthew Gordon
    Just some of code in Tea folder is really used in Pet framework.

Kangjian and PengWan contributed code for the Pet.pl and recorder modules.
